Note: currently, the BayesFactor and BEST analyses are ran on files where words are marked by their gram. gender in GERMAN. This means 1. in the BF analysis, an interaction btw language and sex indicates within-language gender congruent associations, and in the BEST analysis, differences between groups indicate within-language gender congruent.
In contrast, in the multilevel regression, raw association scores are the outcome and within-language gender is used as the predictor. So here, a main effect of sex, without an interaction, indicates within-language gender congruent associations.

I have no idea what I'm doing.
